Distribution Viwer
=============================

Hello! This is my very first Shiny App. It is part of a [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org) course called Developing Data Products, part of Data Science specialization. It is a very simple app containing three distribution viewers with histogram drawn from random samples. It written in R language with the Shiny library.  
  
The app can be accessed [here at Shiny Apps](https://celsofaf.shinyapps.io/coursera-datasci-devdataprods/)  
Basic documentation, written in RStudio Presenter, can [be found here](http://rpubs.com/celsofaf/39562)  
  
Source codes for the app and the presentation are right here at my GitHub. Enjoy!
